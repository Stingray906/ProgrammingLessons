    <p><cite>The Fault in our Stars</cite> by John Green</p>
    <p>Here is Britannica brief summary of lord of the rings</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Lord-of-the-Rings">The Lord of the Rings, fantasy novel by
        J.R.R. Tolkien initially published in three parts as The Fellowship of the Ring (1954),
        The Two Towers (1955), and The Return of the King (1955). The novel, set in the Third Age of Middle-earth,
        formed a sequel to Tolkiens The Hobbit (1937) and was succeeded by his posthumous The Silmarillion (1977).
        The Lord of the Rings is the saga of a group of sometimes reluctant heroes who set forth to save their world
        from consummate evil.
        Its many worlds and creatures were drawn from Tolkiens extensive knowledge of philology and folklore.
