    <p>
        <br>
        This <del>Sumer</del><mark>Summer</mark> I read <ins>the book</ins> The Lord <del>teh</del> <mark>the</mark> of
        Rings.
        <del>It was gud.</del> <b>I enjoy the story very much.</b> I liked that Frodo had <del>his friend </del>Sam to
        help him through his journey.

        <del>He helped to carry him when he was down.</del> <b>Sam helped carry Frodo through very stressful and
            dangerous situations.</b>

        Even when they were being attacked and put down by everyone, <del>he</del> <mark>Sam</mark> was there for him.

        <del>And he had the best pony.</del> <ins>One of my favorite characters was a pony named Bill.</ins>
